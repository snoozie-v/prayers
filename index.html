        <h1>Daily Prayers That Help</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>Serenity Prayer</h2>
                <h3>Short Version</h3>
                <p>GOD, Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage<br/>
                to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference, AMEN</p>
                <h3>Long Version (continued)</h3>
                <p>Living one day at a time; enjoying one moment at a time; accepting<br/>
                hardship as the pathway to peace. Taking, as He did, this sinful world as<br />
                it is, not as I would have it. Trusting that He will make all things right if I<br/>
                surrender to His Will; that I may be reasonably happy in this life, and<br />
                supremely happy with Him foreve in the next. AMEN</p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
                <p>OUR FATHER, who are in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy<br/>
                Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this<br/>
                day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those<br/>
                who trespass against us.  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us<br />
                from evil. For this is the kindom, the power and the glory, forever and<br/>
                ever. Amen</p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>Morning Prayer</h2>
                <p>GOD, direct my thinking today so that it is divorced of self pity,<br/>
                dishonesty, self-will, self-seeking nd fear. God inspure my thinking,<br/>
                decisions and intuitions. Help me to relax and take it easy. Free me from<br/>
                doubt and indecision. Guide me through this day and show me my next step.<br/>
                God, give me what I need to take care of any problems. I ask all these<br/>
                things that I may be of maximum service to you and my fellow man. AMEN</p>
