            <li><h2>Serenity Prayer</h2>
                <h3>Short Version</h3>
                <p>GOD, Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage<br/>
                to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference, AMEN</p>
                <h4>(Continued below)</h4>
                <p>Living one day at a time; enjoying one moment at a time; accepting<br/>
                hardship as the pathway to peace. Taking, as He did, this sinful world as<br />
                it is, not as I would have it. Trusting that He will make all things right if I<br/>
                surrender to His Will; that I may be reasonably happy in this life, and<br />
                supremely happy with Him foreve in the next. AMEN</p>

            <li><h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
                <p>OUR FATHER, who are in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy<br/>
                Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this<br/>
                day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those<br/>
                who trespass against us.  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us<br />
                from evil. For this is the kindom, the power and the glory, forever and<br/>
                ever. Amen</p>

            <li><h2> St Francis Prayer</h2>
                <p>LORD, make me a channel of thy peace, that where there is hatred, I may<br/>
                bring love; that where there is wrong, I may bring the sprirt of<br/>
                forgiveness; that where there is discord, I may bring harmony; that where<br/>
                there is error, I may bring truth; that where there is doubt, I may bring<br/>
                faith; that where there is despair, I may bring hope; that where there are<br/>
                shadows, I may bring light; that where there is sadness, I may bring joy.<br/>
            
                <br/>LORD, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to becomforted; to<br/>
                understand, than to be understood; to love, than to be loved. For it is by<br />
                self-forgetting that one finds. It is by forgiving that one is forgiven. It is<br />
                by dying that one awakens to eternal life. AMEN <br/>

                <p>GOD, direct my thinking today so that it is divorced of self pity,<br/>

                decisions and intuitions. Help me to relax and take it easy. Free me from<br/>
                doubt and indecision. Guide me through this day and show me my next step.<br/>
                God, give me what I need to take care of any problems. I ask all these<br/>
                things that I may be of maximum service to you and my fellow man. <br/>
